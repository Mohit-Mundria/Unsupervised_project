In this project, I applied the KMeans clustering algorithm to the "winequality-red" dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to cluster the wine samples into groups based on their attributes and
determine whether a wine is "redwine" or not, providing an unsupervised learning solution to classify the wine quality data.
Libraries Used:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy: Numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization and plotting.
Scikit-learn: KMeans clustering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
Python: General programming and data handling.
Learning Outcomes:
Gained practical experience in unsupervised learning with KMeans clustering.
Enhanced data preprocessing skills by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Improved my ability to visualize and interpret clustering results using dimensionality reduction (PCA).
